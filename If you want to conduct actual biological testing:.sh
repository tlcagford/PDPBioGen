# 1. Install the software
git clone https://github.com/tlcagford/PDPBioGen
cd PDPBioGen
poetry install

# 2. Create test biological scenarios
# Test with known protein families (e.g., globins, kinases)
# Use sequences with validated evolutionary relationships

# 3. Compare against manual methods
# Run same analysis manually with BLAST+ and MAFFT
# Compare results for consistency

# 4. Validate output biological correctness
# Check alignment quality
# Verify phylogenetic signal makes biological sense
