# PDPBioGen Validation — Methods Summary

This short whitepaper accompanies the NV vs classical phantom validation package.
It describes the rationale, simulated hardware assumptions, metrics, and analysis.

- Objective: quantify detection advantage of NV vs classical magnetometer in controlled phantom tests.
- Methods: see docs/PROTOCOL.md and notebooks/validation_experiment.ipynb
- Metrics: LOD, SNR improvement (dB), ROC AUC, false positive rates
