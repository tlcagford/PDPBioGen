C. Step-by-Step Procedure

Day 1: Cell Seeding and Differentiation

    Seed Cells: Count THP-1 cells and seed them in a 12-well plate at a density of 500,000 cells per well in 1 mL of complete growth medium.

    Differentiate: Add PMA to each well to a final concentration of 100 nM. Gently swirl the plate to mix.

    Incubate: Place the plate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 48 hours. The cells will adhere and differentiate into macrophage-like cells.

Day 3: Resting Phase
4. Remove PMA: Carefully aspirate the medium from each well.
5. Wash & Rest: Gently add 1 mL of fresh, warm, PMA-free medium to each well. Return the plate to the incubator for another 24 hours. This allows the cells to rest.

Day 4: Compound Treatment and Stimulation
6. Prepare Compounds: Dilute Compound X in DMSO and then in culture medium to create your working concentrations (e.g., 1 µM and 10 µM). Prepare a vehicle control (0.1% DMSO) and LPS solution (100 ng/mL).
7. Pre-treatment: Aspirate the resting medium.
* Group G1 (Control): Add 1 mL of fresh medium with vehicle.
* Group G2 (LPS-only): Add 1 mL of fresh medium with vehicle.
* Groups G3 & G4: Add 1 mL of medium containing 1 µM or 10 µM Compound X, respectively.
8. Incubate: Incubate the plate for 1 hour.
9. Stimulate: After 1 hour, add LPS directly to the wells for groups G2, G3, and G4 to a final concentration of 100 ng/mL. Do not add LPS to Group G1.
10. Final Incubation: Incubate the plate for 6 hours (this is the optimal time for cytokine mRNA induction).

Day 4: Cell Lysis and RNA Extraction
11. Lyse Cells: Place the plate on ice. Aspirate the medium and wash each well once with 1 mL of cold PBS. Aspirate the PBS completely.
12. Add Lysis Buffer: Add 350 µL of RLT buffer (from the RNA kit) directly to each well. Lyse the cells by pipetting up and down several times.
13. RNA Extraction: Transfer the lysate to a labeled microcentrifuge tube and immediately proceed with the RNA extraction protocol according to the kit's instructions. This typically involves binding to a column, washing, and eluting in RNase-free water.
14. Quantify RNA: Measure the concentration and purity (A260/A280 ratio ~2.0) of your RNA using a spectrophotometer.

Day 4/5: cDNA Synthesis
15. Normalize RNA: Dilute all RNA samples to the same concentration (e.g., 50 ng/µL) in RNase-free water.
16. Set Up RT Reaction: In a PCR tube, combine:
* 500 ng RNA (10 µL of 50 ng/µL solution)
* 2 µL 10x RT Buffer
* 0.8 µL dNTP Mix (25x)
* 2 µL 10x RT Random Primers
* 1 µL MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase
* 4.2 µL Nuclease-free H2O
* Total Volume: 20 µL
17. Run RT Program: Place tubes in a thermal cycler and run the program: 25°C for 10 min, 37°C for 120 min, 85°C for 5 min, hold at 4°C. The resulting product is your cDNA. Dilute 1:5 with water for qPCR.

Day 5: qPCR Setup & Run
18. Prepare Master Mix: For each reaction, calculate and combine:
* 5.0 µL TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (2x)
* 0.5 µL TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (20x)
* 3.5 µL Nuclease-free H2O
* Total per reaction: 9 µL
Prepare a master mix for all your samples, targets, and technical replicates, plus ~10% extra.
19. Plate Setup: Aliquot 9 µL of the master mix into each well of a 96-well qPCR plate.
20. Add cDNA: Add 1 µL of the diluted cDNA to each respective well.
21. Seal and Centrifuge: Seal the plate with an optical adhesive cover and centrifuge briefly to collect the contents at the bottom.
22. Run qPCR: Place the plate in the qPCR instrument and run the appropriate protocol (e.g., 95°C for 20 sec, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 1 sec and 60°C for 20 sec).
D. Data Analysis & Population of BAIS File

    Export Data: Export the Cq (Quantification Cycle) values from the qPCR instrument software.

    Quality Control: Check that your control gene (GAPDH) has stable, low Cq values across all samples. Ensure the No Template Control (NTC) has no amplification (Cq = undetermined).

    Calculate ΔΔCq:

        Calculate the average Cq for technical replicates for each sample/target.

        ΔCq (Sample) = Avg. Cq (IL-6, Sample) - Avg. Cq (GAPDH, Sample)

        ΔΔCq = ΔCq (Sample) - ΔCq (Calibrator Sample; e.g., LPS-only group G2)

        Fold Change = 2^(-ΔΔCq)

    Statistical Analysis: Perform a t-test or ANOVA on the ΔCq or Fold Change values to determine statistical significance between groups.

    Populate BAIS File: Use a script (e.g., in Python or R) or manually enter all the metadata, protocol details, raw Cq data, analysis parameters, and final fold-change results into the JSON structure defined in Part 1.
