#Parallel Distributed Processing for Multi-Scale Biological Integration and Brain-Guided Healing#

Python Version CI/CD

#PDPBioGen is a cutting-edge computational framework that bridges brain signals, biological processes, and healing optimization through parallel distributed processing and multi-agent AI collaboration.

#✨ What Makes Us Different
Traditional Approach PDPBioGen Approach

#❌ Single-domain analysis ✅ Multi-scale integration (molecular → cellular → organ)

#❌ Sequential processing ✅ Parallel distributed computing across all domains

#❌ Static models ✅ Dynamic, brain-guided optimization

#❌ Isolated systems ✅ Cross-domain verification & collaboration

#🎯 Core Capabilities

#🧬 Multi-Scale Biological Integration
PDPBioGen — 
Parallel Distributed Processing BioGen
PDPBioGen is a modular, multi-domain research framework for integrating neural, genomic, and metabolic data into a combined analysis and agent-driven optimization pipeline
