### Parallel Distributed Processing for Multi-Scale Biological Integration & Brain-Guided Healing Simulation

**PDPBioGen** is an open-source research framework integrating:

- EEG / BCI signals  
- Neuro-Symmetry Mapper (NSM)  
- Gene-expression surrogate modeling  
- Constraint-based metabolic simulation (COBRA)  
- Healing-state flux prediction


🧠 PDPBioGen × Neuro-Symmetry Mapper

Parallel Distributed Processing for Multi-Scale Biological Integration and Brain-Guided Healing

Python Version CI/CD

PDPBioGen is a cutting-edge computational framework that bridges brain signals, biological processes, and healing optimization through parallel distributed processing and multi-agent AI collaboration.
✨ What Makes Us Different
Traditional Approach PDPBioGen Approach

❌ Single-domain analysis ✅ Multi-scale integration (molecular → cellular → organ)

❌ Sequential processing ✅ Parallel distributed computing across all domains

❌ Static models ✅ Dynamic, brain-guided optimization

❌ Isolated systems ✅ Cross-domain verification & collaboration

🎯 Core Capabilities
🧬 Multi-Scale Biological Integration
PDPBioGen — Parallel Distributed Processing BioGen

PDPBioGen is a modular, multi-domain research framework for integrating neural, genomic, and metabolic data into a combined analysis and agent-driven optimization pipeline
