PDPBioGen is a cutting-edge computational framework that bridges **brain signals**, **biological processes**, and **healing optimization** through parallel distributed processing and multi-agent AI collaboration.

### ✨ What Makes Us Different

| Traditional Approach | PDPBioGen Approach |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| ❌ Single-domain analysis | ✅ **Multi-scale integration** (molecular → cellular → organ) |
| ❌ Sequential processing | ✅ **Parallel distributed computing** across all domains |
| ❌ Static models | ✅ **Dynamic, brain-guided optimization** |
| ❌ Isolated systems | ✅ **Cross-domain verification & collaboration** |

## 🎯 Core Capabilities

### 🧬 Multi-Scale Biological Integration

# PDPBioGen — Parallel Distributed Processing BioGen

PDPBioGen is a modular, multi-domain research framework for integrating neural, genomic, and metabolic data into a combined analysis and agent-driven optimization pipeline.

This repository contains:
- a clean Python package (`pdpbiogen/`) with domain mappers, an Integrator, and validation utilities;
- sample synthetic datasets (`data/sample/`);
- unit & integration tests (`tests/`) using `pytest`;
- a runnable example in `examples/cross_domain_run.py`.

## Quick start

1. Create virtual env and install
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```python
# Simultaneous analysis across all biological domains
integrator = CrossDomainIntegrator()
human_map = integrator.create_human_map({
    'neural': brain_activity_data,
    'genomic': gene_expression_data, 
    'metabolic': pathway_activity_data
A verified multi-agent framework for multi-scale human biological integration to biological systems.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install package
pip install neuro-symmetry-mapper

# OR install from source
